## üìñ Introduction to Rootstock and the `demo-code-snippets` Repository

Rootstock merges the benefits of Ethereum with the Bitcoin ecosystem. The `demo-code-snippets` repository is a vital tool for developers, offering code examples tailored for the Rootstock network.

## üîß Pre-requisites

Before diving into the code snippets and setting up tools on Rootstock and RIF, ensure you meet the following requirements:

### üìò Technical Knowledge
- Foundational knowledge of Solidity and Hardhat.

### üñ•Ô∏è Node and npm Requirements
To utilize npm commands and install the demos, you'll need Node.js. Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager) which will be essential for setting up and managing the dependencies of the demos.

1. **Installing Node.js**: Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). This will also install npm.
2. **Verifying Installation**: 
    - After installation, open your terminal or command prompt and type `node -v`. This should display the version of Node.js installed.
    - Similarly, verify npm by typing `npm -v` to display the version of npm installed.

Once Node.js and npm are set up, you can use npm commands to install and manage the `demo-code-snippets` and their dependencies.

### üñ•Ô∏è Node Requirements for Running an RSK Node
To effectively run an RSK node, your system should meet the following minimum requirements:

- **Cores**: 2
- **RAM**: 8 GB
- **Storage**: 128 GB
- **OS**: x64

### üåç Supported Systems for RSK Node Installation
Depending on your platform, there are various methods available for installing and running an RSK node:

#### üíº Local Systems
- **Linux**: Ubuntu Package, CentOS, Fat JAR, Docker
- **Mac**: Fat JAR, Docker
- **Windows**: Fat JAR, Docker

#### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Systems
- **AWS**: AWS AMI, Ubuntu Package, Docker
- **Azure**: Azure VM Image, Ubuntu Package, Docker
- **Google Cloud**: Ubuntu Package, Fat JAR, Docker

Ensure you choose the installation method that aligns with your platform and is most comfortable for your development environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting up and Using Tools on Rootstock and RIF

To effectively set up and use tools on Rootstock and RIF, follow the outlined steps:

1. **Create a New Branch**:
   Before making any changes, start by creating a new branch in the `demo-code-snippets` repository. This ensures the main codebase remains unaltered until your changes are reviewed and merged.

2. **Create a Specific Folder for Your Demo**:
   In your branch, create a new folder dedicated to your specific demo. This organizational structure helps in easily locating and managing demos.

3. **Add a Short, Self-Contained, Correct Example (SSCCE)**:
   Within the newly created folder, add your code. Ensure that your example is:
   - Short: It should be concise and focus on a specific functionality.
   - Self-contained: The code should be independent and not rely on external or unrelated components.
   - Correct: The example should run without errors and demonstrate its intended functionality.

4. **Include a README.md**:
   Accompany your demo with a `README.md` file in the same folder. This file should provide details about the demo. Specifically, it should have:
   - `## What this demo does`: Explain the functionality or problem the demo addresses.
   - `## How this demo works`: Describe the underlying mechanisms, functions, or methodologies the demo employs.

5. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**:
   Once your demo is ready and documented, submit a Pull Request to the main `demo-code-snippets` repository. Your PR description should be comprehensive and include:
   - `## What`: Briefly describe what the PR addresses or the functionality of your demo.
   - `## Why`: Explain the significance or reason for your demo. Why should it be added to the repository?
   - `## Refs`: List any references, external sources, or related documentation that influenced or are related to your demo.

Remember, clear and detailed documentation aids in the review process and ensures that other developers can understand, utilize, and learn from your demo.

> üìò : Ensure you have all dependencies installed and check for any additional configurations required for the specific code snippet.

## üéì Demonstrating Tool Usage with `demo-code-snippets`

The `demo-code-snippets` repository is designed to guide developers through practical examples. It's crucial to:

- Familiarize yourself with the range of code snippets available.
- Understand the context and application of each snippet.
- Test each snippet in a controlled environment before integrating it into your main project.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting & FAQ

### üêû Common Issues and Their Solutions

#### 1. I'm having issues cloning the `demo-code-snippets` repository. What should I do?

- **Solution**: Verify your permissions, internet connection, and the repository URL.

#### 2. A code snippet throws an error. How do I fix it?

- **Solution**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and match the required versions. Check the repository for known issues or raise a new one.

#### 3. How frequently are the code snippets updated?

- **Solution**: Updates vary. Monitor the repository for the latest commits or watch it on GitHub.

#### 4. I'm facing a "gas limit exceeded" error while deploying a smart contract. What's wrong?

- **Solution**: This error typically means the contract requires more gas than the current gas limit. You can either optimize your contract to use less gas or increase the gas limit when deploying.

#### 5. My transactions on Rootstock are very slow. How can I speed them up?

- **Solution**: Transaction speeds can vary based on network congestion and the gas price set for the transaction. Consider increasing the gas price for higher priority.

#### 6. I'm having trouble connecting my local development environment to the Rootstock testnet. Any suggestions?

- **Solution**: Ensure you've properly configured your connection settings. Refer to the Rootstock documentation for guidance on connecting to the testnet.

#### 7. I deployed my smart contract on Rootstock, but I can't interact with it. What could be the issue?

- **Solution**: Verify the contract's ABI and address. Ensure you're using the correct tools and libraries compatible with Rootstock for contract interactions.

### ü§î Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q: I'm new to blockchain development. Where do I start?
