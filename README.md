## 📖 Introduction to Rootstock and the `demo-code-snippets` Repository

Rootstock merges the benefits of Ethereum with the Bitcoin ecosystem. The `demo-code-snippets` repository is a vital tool for developers, offering code examples tailored for the Rootstock network.

## 🔧 Pre-requisites

Before diving into the code snippets and setting up tools on Rootstock and RIF, ensure you meet the following requirements:

### 📘 Technical Knowledge & Environment Setup

- **Solidity & Hardhat**: A foundational understanding of Solidity programming and the Hardhat development environment is essential.
  
- **Full Stack Development on RSK**: Before diving into the demos, ensure you've completed the [Full Stack Dapp on RSK Guide](https://dev.rootstock.io/guides/full-stack-dapp-on-rsk/part1-overview/). This guide will give you a comprehensive overview of developing decentralized applications on the Rootstock platform.

- **Node.js Environment**: Node.js is foundational for many blockchain development tasks. If you haven't installed Node.js yet, get it [here](https://nodejs.org/). This will also equip you with npm (Node Package Manager), crucial for managing dependencies.

- **Project-Specific Tools/Setups**: Remember, each demo or project might have unique requirements. Always refer to the project-specific documentation to ensure you have all necessary tools and configurations in place.

Once you've set up Node.js and npm, you're primed to use npm commands. These commands will help you install, manage, and run the demos from the `demo-code-snippets` repository and handle their dependencies seamlessly.


### 🖥️ Node Requirements for Running an RSK Node
To effectively run an RSK node, your system should meet the following minimum requirements:

- **Cores**: 2
- **RAM**: 8 GB
- **Storage**: 128 GB
- **OS**: x64

### 🌍 Supported Systems for RSK Node Installation
Depending on your platform, there are various methods available for installing and running an RSK node:

#### 💼 Local Systems
- **Linux**: Ubuntu Package, CentOS, Fat JAR, Docker
- **Mac**: Fat JAR, Docker
- **Windows**: Fat JAR, Docker

#### ☁️ Cloud Systems
- **AWS**: AWS AMI, Ubuntu Package, Docker
- **Azure**: Azure VM Image, Ubuntu Package, Docker
- **Google Cloud**: Ubuntu Package, Fat JAR, Docker

Ensure you choose the installation method that aligns with your platform and is most comfortable for your development environment.

## 🛠️ Setting up and Using Tools on Rootstock and RIF

To effectively set up and use tools on Rootstock and RIF, follow the outlined steps:

1. **Create a New Branch**:
   Before making any changes, start by creating a new branch in the `demo-code-snippets` repository. This ensures the main codebase remains unaltered until your changes are reviewed and merged.

2. **Create a Specific Folder for Your Demo**:
   In your branch, create a new folder dedicated to your specific demo. This organizational structure helps in easily locating and managing demos.

3. **Add a Short, Self-Contained, Correct Example (SSCCE)**:
   Within the newly created folder, add your code. Ensure that your example is:
   - Short: It should be concise and focus on a specific functionality.
   - Self-contained: The code should be independent and not rely on external or unrelated components.
   - Correct: The example should run without errors and demonstrate its intended functionality.

4. **Include a README.md**:
   Accompany your demo with a `README.md` file in the same folder. This file should provide details about the demo. Specifically, it should have:
   - `## What this demo does`: Explain the functionality or problem the demo addresses.
   - `## How this demo works`: Describe the underlying mechanisms, functions, or methodologies the demo employs.

5. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**:
   Once your demo is ready and documented, submit a Pull Request to the main `demo-code-snippets` repository. Your PR description should be comprehensive and include:
   - `## What`: Briefly describe what the PR addresses or the functionality of your demo.
   - `## Why`: Explain the significance or reason for your demo. Why should it be added to the repository?
   - `## Refs`: List any references, external sources, or related documentation that influenced or are related to your demo.

Remember, clear and detailed documentation aids in the review process and ensures that other developers can understand, utilize, and learn from your demo.

> 📘 : Ensure you have all dependencies installed and check for any additional configurations required for the specific code snippet.

## 🎓 Demonstrating Tool Usage with `demo-code-snippets`

The `demo-code-snippets` repository is designed to guide developers through practical examples. It's crucial to:

- Familiarize yourself with the range of code snippets available.
- Understand the context and application of each snippet.
- Test each snippet in a controlled environment before integrating it into your main project.

## ❓ Troubleshooting & FAQ

### 🐞 Common Issues and Their Solutions

#### 1. I'm having issues cloning the `demo-code-snippets` repository. What should I do?

- **Solution**: Verify your permissions, internet connection, and the repository URL.

#### 2. A code snippet throws an error. How do I fix it?

- **Solution**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and match the required versions. Check the repository for known issues or raise a new one.
